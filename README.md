# Insurance Application
The insurance application is a website portal for customers, employees, and managers to view and modify applications and user information. Customers could sign up and apply for insurance policies. Employees could review and verify customer information and collect any further information needed.

## Back-end technologies:
• Implemented back-end API using Spring REST and tested endpoints using Postman
• Worked closed with other back-end developers to fulfill behavioral and functional requirements for RESTful web services.
• Utilized Java Mail API to send confirmation and marketing emails.
• Configured the MySQL database and used Hibernate as ORM (Object Relational Mapping) solution to communicate between Spring Boot and the database. 
• Implemented Spring Security to authenticate and authorize users 
• Used Stripe API as a 3rd party checkout gateway. 
• Built upon existing API to provide more functionality for the front end.
• Extended the API available for more niche tasks
• Managed source code with Git and remote repository GitHub.

## Front-end technologies:
• Used MSW as API mocking services for testing development and debugging.
• Configured page routing during development with React Router.
• Displayed table data with custom directives and pagination.
• Custom basic validation using JavaScript.
• Utilized Redux design pattern to provide global access to other components.
• Engineered Stripe API to generate tokens and support back-end with checkouts.
• Designed the front-end UI look and feel with Material UI. 
• Managed source code with Git and remote repository GitHub.The insurance application is a website portal for customers, employees, and managers to view and modify applications and user information.
